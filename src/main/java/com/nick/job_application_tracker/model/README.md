# üì¶ Models

This directory contains the core JPA entities used in the **JobTrackr** application.  
Each entity maps to a relational database table and represents essential concepts in job tracking, user management, and audit logging.

  Stores files related to job applications, such as job descriptions, offer letters, or interview prep materials.

* [`AuditLog.java`](./AuditLog.java)  
  Tracks user actions (e.g., `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) across the system for accountability and auditing.

* [`CommunicationLog.java`](./CommunicationLog.java)  
  Records communication activity tied to a job application, such as emails, calls, or LinkedIn messages.

## üß© Enums

* [`Role.java`](./Role.java)  
  Enumerates user roles (e.g., `BASIC`).

* **Embedded Enums** (defined within their respective models):

  * `ApplicationTimeline.EventType`

## üîç Suggestions for Further Improvements

If you're maintaining this README with a focus on the database structure, consider adding:

- ‚úÖ **Cardinality annotations** (e.g., `1 ‚Üí *`, `* ‚Üí 1`) next to each relationship in the diagram or legend
- ‚úÖ **Descriptions of relationships** (e.g., "`JobApplication` has many `Attachments`")
- ‚úÖ **Glossary of Enums** with possible values (e.g., `Status: APPLIED | INTERVIEW | OFFER | REJECTED`)
- ‚úÖ **ERD generation script** if the schema is auto-generated
- ‚úÖ **How to regenerate schema.sql** instructions (e.g., `pg_dump` command)
- ‚úÖ **Seeding or test data** references, if applicable

Let me know if you'd like to auto-document the schema with tools like [SchemaSpy](http://schemaspy.org/) or [JPA Buddy ERD generator].
