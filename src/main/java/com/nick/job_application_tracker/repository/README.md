# üóÉÔ∏è Repositories ‚Äî `com.nick.job_application_tracker.repository`

This package contains all Spring Data JPA repositories used in the **JobTrackr** application.  
Repositories provide out-of-the-box CRUD operations and are used in service classes to abstract database interactions.

## üîç Custom Query Methods

Many repositories extend standard `JpaRepository<T, ID>` functionality with **custom finders**, including:

```java
List<JobApplication> findByUserId(Long userId);
Optional<User> findByEmail(String email);
List<Attachment> findByJobApplicationId(Long jobId);
Optional<Location> findByCityAndCountry(String city, String country);
````

These methods follow Spring Data‚Äôs **method name conventions** and are automatically translated into SQL queries.

## üß† Notes

* All repositories are annotated with `@Repository` and picked up automatically by Spring Boot.
* Each repository is tightly coupled with a model/entity in [`model/`](../model/README.md).
* Custom queries can be expanded with:

  * `@Query` annotations (JPQL or native SQL)
  * Specifications (`JpaSpecificationExecutor`), if needed
* Query results like `Optional<T>` or `List<T>` help ensure null-safe, expressive interfaces.

## üß™ Repository Testing

Recommended tools for testing repository behavior:

* `@DataJpaTest` with embedded H2 or TestContainers
* `TestEntityManager` for setup and assertions
* Mocking repositories only for service-level tests
