# üß© Services ‚Äì `com.nick.job_application_tracker.service`

This package contains the **business logic layer** of the **JobTrackr** application.
Services coordinate data flow between controllers, repositories, and mappers, while applying validation, ownership checks, and audit logging.

---

## üõ† What Services Do

* Receive DTOs from controllers and convert them to entities
* Perform validation and handle relational consistency (e.g. ensure referenced `JobApplication` exists)
* Persist data via repositories
* Log operations through the `AuditLogService`
* Return DTOs back to controllers for safe and structured API responses
