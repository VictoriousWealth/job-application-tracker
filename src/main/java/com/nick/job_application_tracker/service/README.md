# Services

This directory contains the business logic layer of the JobTrackr application.  
Services orchestrate operations between controllers, repositories, and mappers, handling data processing, validation, and audit logging.

## Core Application Services:

- [JobApplicationService.java](./JobApplicationService.java) â€” Manages job application creation, retrieval, and deletion.
- [FollowUpReminderService.java](./FollowUpReminderService.java) â€” Handles follow-up reminders linked to job applications.
- [ScheduledCommunicationService.java](./ScheduledCommunicationService.java) â€” Manages scheduled events like interviews and assessments.
- [SkillTrackerService.java](./SkillTrackerService.java) â€” Tracks skills associated with job applications.

## User and Authentication Services:

- [UserService.java](./UserService.java) â€” Manages user account operations (view, update, deactivate, enable/disable).
- [AuditLogService.java](./AuditLogService.java) â€” Logs create, update, and delete operations throughout the system for traceability.

- Mapping between entities and DTOs is handled before passing data to or from the controller layer.
